# USC Spack configs

The [Center for Advanced Research Computing](https://carc.usc.edu/) (CARC) at the University of Southern California (USC) uses Spack to build and maintain the HPC software stacks that are used on both the general-use cluster Discovery and the condo cluster Endeavour.

The config subdirectory contains our Spack config files. The packages.yaml config file changes more frequently than the others.
